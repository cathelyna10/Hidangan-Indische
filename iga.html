    <p>Originating from the vibrant culinary traditions of East Java, Indonesia, "Iga Penyet" translates directly to "smashed ribs." This dish offers a unique fusion of flavors and textures that embodies Indonesian cuisine. Tender beef ribs are first simmered in a rich blend of spices, including shallots, garlic, turmeric, and ginger, until they're fall-off-the-bone soft. After boiling, they are briefly fried to achieve a golden, crispy exterior. The "smashing" process involves gently flattening the ribs, enhancing their tenderness and ensuring flavors penetrate deep into the meat. Served with a fiery sambal—a spicy chili paste with hints of shallots, garlic, and tomato—and often accompanied by steamed rice and fresh vegetables, Iga Penyet is a flavorful dish that offers a delightful dance of heat, savory notes, and textural contrasts on the palate. Whether consumed in bustling street-side eateries or upscale restaurants, this dish stands as a testament to Indonesia's rich culinary heritage</p>

            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preparing the Ribs:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Blend all the spice paste ingredients until smooth.</li>
                        <li>In a pot, combine ribs, spice paste, lemongrass, bay leaves, tamarind, salt, pepper, and water. Boil until the ribs are tender, approximately 1 hours.</li>
                        <li>Remove the ribs and set aside. Keep the broth for other uses or as a soup.</li>
                        <li>Heat some oil in a frying pan and fry the ribs until they are golden brown. Set aside.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Preparing the Sambal:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Blend chillies, shallots, and garlic in a food processor until coarse.</li>
                        <li>Heat oil in a pan and sauté the chili mixture until aromatic.</li>
                        <li>Add the tomato, salt, and sugar. Continue to cook until the sambal sauce thickens. Adjust seasoning to taste.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Place the fried ribs in a mortar and gently "smash" them to flatten a bit (this is where the term "penyet" comes from).</li>
                <li>Serve the ribs with sambal on the side, steamed rice, and perhaps some slices of cucumber and tomato for freshness.</li>
